Hello! This repo holds two pixel fonts I made for constructed languages, Toki Pona and Tuki Tiki, using BirdFont.

First I made my Tuki Tiki font, [kiku upi ala](https://kelseyhigham.github.io/kiku-upi-ala) (old rocks). It was the first Tuki Tiki font ever made!

Then I made my Toki Pona font, [leko majuna](https://kelseyhigham.github.io/leko-majuna) (old squares).

Later, I've made a tool to help people create their own fonts, [SP Font Maker](https://github.com/wasokeli/sp-font-maker). To try it out, I made a new version, [leko majuna sin](https://wasokeli.github.io/sp-font-maker/leko-majuna-sin) (new old squares). It has newer glyphs, but fewer features, due to limitations in SP Font Maker.
